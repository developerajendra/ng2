          "question": "What’s the strongest prescription that you can fill?",
          "answer": "The strongest prescription we can fill is +/-10.00 sphere, or +/-4.00 cylinder. If you have a stronger prescription than that, you can purchase our frames without lenses and have your prescription filled locally by your optometrist. Frames without lenses cost $80.00."

Because the trial is “free,” the kits often encounter problems going through customs, and can end up costing an incredible sum of money in duties and taxes. As an alternative, if there’s a frame that you absolutely love, we’d recommend that you order it to see how it fits and feels – We will gladly accept your return within 30 days if they don’t work out."
